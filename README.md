# creaftOS

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of creaftOS, the platform designed to simulate a rich and interactive society within Minecraft. Here you'll find the source code and documentation for the legacy version of creaftOS, which laid the groundwork for its successor, craftSystem.

## About creaftOS
creaftOS was a pioneering project that integrated real-life societal elements into Minecraft, offering features like a dynamic economy, property and land management, team collaborations, and a suite of tools for server administrationâ€”all managed through a complementary app interface.

### Final Version
This repository represents the final version of creaftOS as support has been officially discontinued. We encourage the community to explore craftSystem, available through a licensing model to support its ongoing development. However, creaftOS remains as an open-source resource for those interested in its architecture and concepts.

## Discontinuation and Transition to craftSystem
The development of creaftOS has ceased in favor of craftSystem, which has been launched in a public preview at [cou.ai](https://cou.ai). craftSystem follows a licensing model that contributes to its further development and enhances the sustainability of the project.
