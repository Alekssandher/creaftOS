# CraftOS

Nearly five years ago I started this project and back then it run on meteor, then I used react for some time until I finally use vue.js

Some features were never ported and I have or... you have to implement them.

So if you're a tinker, and always wanted to create a "Internet of Minecraft" (well more a Intranet) then clone the source and put some love in it.

I've made it before I started my appreantice ship and since then never found interest in again. 

But i'd like to see it used, because it has a lot of potential and offers alot of fun. Especially those who like economy simulatations... and well Minecraft.

## Features

- A lot. Really. 

I can start listing every module I wrote back then, but it doesn't make sense. I tested some, you CAN upload items, download them back to the game and sell them in the market. You can upload XP's (11 at a time) and download them back to the game. You can send xp (only from the test page) and the bounty system does work aswell. But there are so many methods (for example in the team module) that does not work because the syntax of the server commands changed. Oh and did I mention, that this is possibible with a vanilla server? The software creates a child process and listens to events. I just tested the latest snapshot server. 

Have a look at the screenshots and you'll get the idea.

Open Issues and tell me how you like it. And if you're really seriuos and want me to work for you, just hit me up.
